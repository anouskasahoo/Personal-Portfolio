# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. This project showcases my skills, experience, and work in web development, presenting a clean, modern interface. The portfolio is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building a dynamic, single-page application.

- **Vite**: A fast and optimized build tool for modern web development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling (used for layout and responsiveness).
- **Framer Motion**: To add smooth animations and transitions.
- **Lucide React**: For icons across the portfolio.
- **react-router-dom**: For client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between sections.
- **tsparticles**: To create interactive particle animations for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Smooth Animations**: Interactive animations powered by **Framer Motion** and **tsparticles**.
- **Multi-Section Layout**: Includes sections for an introduction, skills, projects, contact information, and more.
